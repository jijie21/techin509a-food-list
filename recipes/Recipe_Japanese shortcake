Japanese shortcake, also known as "sponge cake," is a delicious and light dessert that's perfect for any occasion. Here's a recipe for making a classic Japanese shortcake:

Ingredients:

For the Sponge Cake:

4 large eggs
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
1 cup (120g) cake flour
1/4 cup (30g) cornstarch
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 cup (60ml) whole milk
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the Filling and Decoration:

2 cups (480ml) heavy whipping cream
3 tbsp powdered sugar (adjust to taste)
1 tsp vanilla extract
Fresh strawberries or fruit of your choice
Fruit jam or jelly for glaze (apricot or strawberry work well)
Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans with parchment paper.
2. Prepare the sponge cake:

Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Set aside.
In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside.
In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs at medium speed for about 1 minute.
Gradually add the granulated sugar while continuing to beat. Beat until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy, about 8-10 minutes.
Gently fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture in three parts, being careful not to overmix.
Add the milk-butter mixture and fold until well combined.
3. Bake the cakes:

Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
4. Prepare the whipped cream filling:

In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.
5. Assemble the shortcake:

Place one of the sponge cake layers on a serving plate.
Spread a layer of whipped cream on top of the cake.
Add a layer of fresh fruit (usually sliced strawberries).
Place the second sponge cake layer on top and press gently.
Frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.
Decorate the top with more fresh fruit.
Optionally, warm some fruit jam or jelly in a saucepan, then strain and brush it over the fruit on top of the cake to create a glossy glaze.
6. Chill and serve:

Refrigerate the cake for at least a few hours or overnight to let the flavors meld.
Slice and serve your delicious Japanese shortcake!
Enjoy your homemade Japanese shortcake! It's a light and delightful dessert that's perfect for special occasions or a sweet treat anytime.
