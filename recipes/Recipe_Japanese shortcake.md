# Japanese Shortcake Recipe

Japanese shortcake, also known as "sponge cake," is a delicious and light dessert that's perfect for any occasion. Here's a recipe for making a classic Japanese shortcake:

## Ingredients:

### For the Sponge Cake:

- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (120g) cake flour
- 1/4 cup (30g) cornstarch
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 cup (60ml) whole milk
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### For the Filling and Decoration:

- 2 cups (480ml) heavy whipping cream
- 3 tbsp powdered sugar (adjust to taste)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Fresh strawberries or fruit of your choice
- Fruit jam or jelly for glaze (apricot or strawberry work well)

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat the oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line two 8-inch (20cm) round cake pans with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare the sponge cake:**
   - Sift together the cake flour, cornstarch, and baking powder. Set aside.
   - In a saucepan, heat the milk and butter until the butter melts. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Set aside.
   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs at medium speed for about 1 minute.
   - Gradually add the granulated sugar while continuing to beat. Beat until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy, about 8-10 minutes.
   - Gently fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture in three parts, being careful not to overmix.
   - Add the milk-butter mixture and fold until well combined.

3. **Bake the cakes:**
   - Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

4. **Prepare the whipped cream filling:**
   - In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.

5. **Assemble the shortcake:**
   - Place one of the sponge cake layers on a serving plate.
   - Spread a layer of whipped cream on top of the cake.
   - Add a layer of fresh fruit (usually sliced strawberries).
   - Place the second sponge cake layer on top and press gently.
   - Frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.
   - Decorate the top with more fresh fruit.
   - Optionally, warm some fruit jam or jelly in a saucepan, then strain and brush it over the fruit on top of the cake to create a glossy glaze.

6. **Chill and serve:**
   - Refrigerate the cake for at least a few hours or overnight to let the flavors meld.
   - Slice and serve your delicious Japanese shortcake!

Enjoy your homemade Japanese shortcake! It's a light and delightful dessert that's perfect for special occasions or a sweet treat anytime.
